# Stair Tracker

src\hooks\useStairDetection.ts

This solution:

1. Uses acceleration patterns to detect potential steps
2. Confirms steps using device orientation (tilt)
3. Implements a cooldown period to prevent double-counting steps
4. Estimates elevation gain based on typical stair height
5. Provides real-time feedback about climbing status

Keep in mind:

- This is a basic implementation and might need tuning of the thresholds based on testing
- Device motion sensor accuracy varies between devices
- The elevation calculation is an estimate based on average stair height
- You might want to add data smoothing or additional filters for more accurate detection

We can improve accuracy by:

- Adding a moving average for acceleration values
- Implementing more sophisticated pattern recognition
- Calibrating thresholds based on user movement patterns
- Adding machine learning for better pattern recognition
