# Stair Tracker

src\hooks\useStairDetection.ts

This solution:

1. Uses acceleration patterns to detect potential steps
2. Confirms steps using device orientation (tilt)
3. Implements a cooldown period to prevent double-counting steps
4. Estimates elevation gain based on typical stair height
5. Provides real-time feedback about climbing status

Keep in mind:

- This is a basic implementation and might need tuning of the thresholds based on testing
- Device motion sensor accuracy varies between devices
- The elevation calculation is an estimate based on average stair height
- You might want to add data smoothing or additional filters for more accurate detection

We can improve accuracy by:

- Adding a moving average for acceleration values
- Implementing more sophisticated pattern recognition
- Calibrating thresholds based on user movement patterns
- Adding machine learning for better pattern recognition

## Algorithms

This type of motion analysis is often associated with several algorithms and techniques commonly used in activity recognition and step detection:

### Peak Detection Algorithms

- Simple peak detection with thresholds (what we implemented basically)
- Zero-crossing detection
- Pan-Tompkins algorithm (commonly used for step detection)

### Hidden Markov Models (HMM)

- Used for activity state transitions
- Can differentiate between walking, climbing stairs, running, etc.

### Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)

- Compares motion patterns against known templates
- Particularly useful for recognizing specific movements like stair climbing

### Machine Learning Approaches

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks (particularly CNNs and RNNs)

## Enhancements

An enhanced version includes:

- Moving Average Filter
- Reduces noise in the acceleration data
- Helps prevent false positives

### Hysteresis-based Peak Detection

- Uses separate thresholds for peaks and valleys
- More robust against small fluctuations

### Time-based Constraints  

- Minimum time between steps
- Automatic reset of climbing status

For even more accuracy, you could implement:

- Kalman Filter
