# Blue Nectar Finder

This project is built with .

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

[Supabase](https://supabase.com) is used for authentication and its Postgres database features.

See these [docs](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase) for more information.

## Workflow

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Setup

Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the project with npm.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/timofeysie/blue-nectar-finder.git
cd blue-nectar-finder
npm install
npm run dev
```

The environment variables VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are required in a .env file to run locally, and set as environment variables on the server.

## About

The app was scaffolded using the AI generator [Lovable](https://lovable.dev) using the following prompt:

*Create an app that lets a user register and login then see a lists available blue tooth devices nearby on a list and displays the status of these devices and shows when they have paired with the web app.*

## Device motion

In JavaScript we can listen for devicemotion events to capture acceleration and rotation rate.

Also deviceorientation events to capture the device's orientation in space.

Note that Bluetooth functionality requires HTTPS in production and user permission to access Bluetooth devices.

## XRP Ledger Demo

This app provides a mature version of the XRP Ledger demo code.

See [XRP Concepts](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts) for details about the XRP Ledger.

### AMMs Using JavaScript

The first JavaScript demo involves creating and interacting with Automated Market Makers (AMMs) on the XRP Ledger.

See [XRP Concepts](https://xrpl.org/docs/concepts) for details about the XRP Ledger.

[AMMs Using JavaScript](https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/amm).

Step 1: [Create an AMM](https://xrpl.org/docs/tutorials/javascript/amm/create-an-amm).

The [example code](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/blob/master/_code-samples/quickstart/js/11.create-amm.html) is a single HTML page with vanilla JavaScript.

The implementation here uses a React dashboard component (src\components\XRPLedgeDashboard.tsx) along with the the get accounts utility called from the Seed buttons getAccountsFromSeeds function in the example repo file [_code-samples\quickstart\js\ripplex1-send-xrp.js](https://github.com/XRPLF/xrpl-dev-portal/blob/master/_code-samples/quickstart/js/ripplex1-send-xrp.js) (converted to TypeScript in the lib src\lib\xrpl-helpers.ts utility).

### Using the demo

#### Get Accounts

To get test accounts if you have existing account seeds:
Click Get New Standby Account and Get New Operational Account buttons.

The "Get New Standby Account" and "Get New Operational Account" buttons use the [XRPL Faucet](https://faucet.altnet.rippletest.net/accounts) to get a test account and calls the following API:

```txt
https://faucet.altnet.rippletest.net/accounts
Request Method: POST
```

with the following payload:

```json
{
    "destination": "rsx...",
    "userAgent": "xrpl.js"
}
```

The result should result in a response like this:

```json
{
    "account": {
        "xAddress": "T7Y...",
        "classicAddress": "rsx...",
        "address": "rsx..."
    },
    "amount": 100,
    "transactionHash": "5D6..."
}
```

#### Next check if an AMM pair already exists

An AMM holds two different assets: at most one of these can be XRP, and one or both of them can be tokens.

1. Enter a currency code in the Asset 1 Currency field. For example, XRP.
2. Enter a second currency code in the Asset 2 Currency field. For example, TST.
3. Enter the operational account address in the Asset 2 Issuer field.
4. Click Check AMM.

#### Checking AMM Pairs in the XRP Ledger

When you click the "Check AMM" button in the demo, the following process occurs:

- Asset 1:
  - For XRP: Just enter "XRP" in the currency field (no issuer needed)
  - For other currencies: Enter the currency code (e.g., "USD") and provide an issuer address
- Asset 2:
  - Same rules as Asset 1
- At least one of the assets must be different from the other
- At most one asset can be XRP

##### Example Setup

What Happens Behind the Scenes

- The application connects to the XRP Ledger
- It formats the asset pairs according to XRPL requirements
- Sends an amm_info request to check if an AMM exists for this pair
- The XRPL responds with either:
  - AMM details if one exists (including the AMM account and trading fee)
A "No AMM exists" message if none is found

Common Issues

Invalid parameters error usually means:

- Missing issuer for a non-XRP asset
- Incorrect currency code format
- Invalid issuer address format
- Both assets cannot be XRP
- Both assets must be different
